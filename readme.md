### About the project ###
Main Goal: End to end machine learning project for improving our skills from data engineering all the way to production.
This means setting up APIs to get data, preprocess and analyze data, consider test different shallow - and deep learning models, building a small web app to show energy production forecasts for the coming week.
Data: Will use weather data from DMI and energy production data from Energi Data Service
