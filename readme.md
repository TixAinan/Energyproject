# Energy Forecasting in Denmark based on danish weather data #

## About the project ##
End goal is to have a small interactive web app that shows energy production predictions based on machine learning or deep learning models.
This is intented to be a end-to-end machine learning project for improving our skills from data engineering all the way to production.
This means setting up APIs to get data, preprocess and analyze data, train different shallow - and deep learning models, building a small web app to show energy production forecasts for the coming week.
Decisions might be made just to try out and learn about technologies we haven't used.

**Data**: Will use weather data from DMI and energy production data from Energi Data Service
- ClimateData from DMI
- Energy production data from Energi Data Service

**Possible technologies** 
- Data storage: SQL Server, maybe Azure?
- Data analysis and manipulation: SQL and Pandas
- Machine Learning: XGBoost
- Deep Learning: Pytorch, Huggingface
- Containerizer: Docker
- Webframework: Django, Streamlit, FastAPI, Flask
